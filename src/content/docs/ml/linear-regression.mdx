Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable $y$ and an independent variable $x$. The simple linear model is given by:

$$ y = mx + b $$

where:
- $m$ is the slope (rate of change)
- $b$ is the y-intercept (value when $x = 0$)

## Interactive Exploration

Adjust the slope and intercept below to observe how the regression line fits the data.

## Model Interpretation

The slope parameter $m$ indicates the expected change in $y$ for a one-unit increase in $x$. The intercept $b$ represents the predicted value of $y$ when $x = 0$.

When fitting data, we seek values of $m$ and $b$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals:

$$ \min_{m,b} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (mx_i + b))^2 $$
